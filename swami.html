          <h2>Master of the Bliss of Discrimination</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Vivekananda </b> was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened
            to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali family in his ancestral home at 3
            Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,the capital of British India,
            on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged
            to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father,
            Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High
            Court.Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and
            Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age
            twenty-five.His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout
            housewife.The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father
            and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his
            thinking and personality. Narendranath was interested in
            spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images
            of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was
            fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks.Narendra was mischievous
            and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty
            controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and
            he has sent me one of his demons".
